      <p>Last updated: 08.29.2023</p>
      <p>
        Welcome to Weather Nook! This Privacy Policy outlines how Weathernook
        ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and protects the information you
        provide when using our mobile application (the "App"). We are committed

        the App, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Information Collection and Usage:</strong></p>
      <p>
        Weathernook is designed to provide you with weather information and does
        not collect any personal or user data. We do not gather, store, or share
        any information that could be used to identify you.

      <p><strong>Location Information:</strong></p>
      <p>
        Weather Nook may request access to your device's location to provide you
        with accurate weather forecasts based on your current location. However,
        we do not store or transmit this location data to our servers. Your
        location information is used solely within the app to display local
        weather information.

        Weathernook does not integrate with any third-party services or APIs
        that would require sharing your data with external parties.

      <p><strong>Children's Privacy:</strong></p>
      <p>
        Weather Nook does not collect personal information from children under
        the age of 13.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy:</strong></p>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes
        to our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons.
        We will notify you of any material changes by posting the updated
        Privacy Policy within the App. Your continued use of the App after the
        effective date of the revised Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance
        of the changes.
